#2. Write a Python program to calculate the area of a trapezoid.
h = int(input("Height: "))
a = int(input("Base, first value: "))
b = int(input("Base, second value: "))
S = (a+b)*h/2
print("Expected Output: ", S)
#RESULTS:
#Height: 5
#Base, first value: 5
#Base, second value: 6
#Expected Output:  27.5
